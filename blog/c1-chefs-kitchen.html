     To put it frankly, I’m super excited for this journey ;) 
    </p>
    <p>
     I love that Dev Bootcamp addresses fears and doubts head on. Something I’ve been working on in my everyday life is working through anger, fear and other intense/distracting emotions. It’s so easy to get swept up in these emotions and for a long time I didn’t realize there is another choice. 
    <p>
     Staying in the anxiety, the stress. Experiencing it, not judging yourself for feeling it, then acting from within the storm. This is not easy to do and I’m still learning, but that DBC incorporates this kind of mindset as a part of it’s curriculum get’s me excited for what’s to come.     
    </p>
    <p>
     My expectations of DBC have changed greatly. I definitely find myself sometimes coming from a consumer or restaurant mindset. I think a lot of that has to do with justifying my actions to other people. Saying “yeah it’s 20 weeks and most people land 65k+/yr jobs off the bat” is easy. Much easier than saying “No, I’m not 100% sure coding is for me. I worry that the program is too emotionally centered. But I think working with code is awesome and it makes me feel like I’m behind the curtain and I can’t remember being this excited to learn something and test my limits since I can remember”.

     One is going to sound much better to my family members.

     So yes, I’m having doubts for sure— I’m nervous I’ll be too quick a learner for some people, I’m nervous I’ll look like an idiot compared to others. When I’m sucked up in those thoughts, they feel real— But right now I can tell you (and myself) that these thoughts come from a place of irrational insecurity.    
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s natural to feel like helping someone else is putting yourself behind, or that exposing vulnerability and asking for help means your weak or lesser. Like that there are only 10 jobs for the 17 people in the Chicago cohort and it’s dog eat dog. Is that true? Of course not, that’s ridiculous. We’re all on the path and if you want to find out what you’re capable of you have to become vulnerable and risk failure.    
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyway, enough rambling— It’s Sunday night and I still have to do the week 1 quiz.

     Cheers guys,
