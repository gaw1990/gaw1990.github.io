		<h3>Margins and Borders and Padding, oh my!</h3>

		
		<p>Creating space around HTML elements is easy with CSS! Look at this content nested within a box!</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/nested-box.png" alt="nested content" />

		<p>Where is the padding, border and margin you ask? You're looking right at them!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Padding: The white space between the content and the red dotted box</li>
			<li>Border: You guessed it! That red dotted box? That's the border!</li>
			<li>Margin: The white space between the red dotted box and the black box. (it's like padding for the border)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now that we have that down, let's look at how we give elements padding, borders and margins in CSS!</p>
		

		<p>As you can see here, our content is surrounded by a black block element: </p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/content-box.png" alt="content" />

		<p>We don't like the black box being so close to our content, so we're going to add some padding in CSS like this:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/content-padding-css.png" alt="padding in CSS" />

		<p>Awesome! Now look at how much space our content has!</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/content-padding-pic.png" alt="padding" />

		<p>We gave it 100px of padding on every side! That's great, but now let's make it stand out a little more with a bright magenta border!</p>
		<p>We add the border property into our CSS file:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/magenta-border.png" alt="magenta border" />

		<p>Now our content looks like this:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/magenta-ss.png" alt="magenta border" />

		<p>Which is great.. Except for the fact that our border is WAY too close to the black box element. Lucky for us, we can give the border a little room to breathe with a margin!</p>
		<p>In our CSS file we'll add a margin property to our content like this:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/margin-css.png" alt="magenta border" />

		<p>Now our content is well highlighted and has enough space to breathe!</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../../imgs/margin-ss.png" alt="magenta border" />


		<p>Now go out and create some space of your own and never fear spacing properties in CSS again!</p>
