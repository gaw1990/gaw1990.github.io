1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Working on my site has given me a much clearer idea of what padding, borders and margin do and where they're located. I also learned that they can be a pain in the ass to adjust because changing one element will effect others.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned how to use relative positioning, which is the only positioning element I used in this challenge. I found it a bit confusing and unresponsive at times, but I think I was using the wrong syntax. 

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Easiest to impliment was the text effects, and images. Hardest was the color scheme and spacing of elements. I spent way too much time trying to come up with a good color scheme that would work with my background picture. If I could go back I would have time boxed my color scheme generation to 20 mins and just called it. I acutally found the whole process of design very stressful becuase every time I would change something I felt other things were thrown off. 

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I don't think I had any massive epiphanies, but it was good to get my hands dirty and mess around with CSS. I feel more comfortable now, but I still don't feel very confident with the design aspects.
