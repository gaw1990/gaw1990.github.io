Creating space around HTML elements is easy with CSS! Look at this content nested within a box!

![nested content](../../../resources/nested-box.png)

Where is the padding, border and margin you ask? You're looking right at them!

*   Padding: The white space between the content and the red dotted box
*   Border: You guessed it! That red dotted box? That's the border!
*   Margin: The white space between the red dotted box and the black box. (it's like padding for the border)

Now that we have that down, let's look at how we give elements padding, borders and margins in CSS!

As you can see here, our content is surrounded by a black block element:

![content](../../../resources/content-box.png)

We don't like the black box being so close to our content, so we're going to add some padding in CSS like this:

![padding in CSS](../../../resources/content-padding-css.png)

Awesome! Now look at how much space our content has!

![padding](../../../resources/content-padding-pic.png)

We gave it 100px of padding on every side! That's great, but now let's make it stand out a little more with a bright magenta border!

We add the border property into our CSS file:

![magenta border](../../../resources/magenta-border.png)

Now our content looks like this:

![magenta border](../../../resources/magenta-ss.png)

Which is great.. Except for the fact that our border is WAY too close to the black box element. Lucky for us, we can give the border a little room to breathe with a margin!

In our CSS file we'll add a margin property to our content like this:

![magenta border](../../../resources/margin-css.png)

Now our content is well highlighted and has enough space to breathe!

Now go out and create some space of your own and never fear spacing properties in CSS again!
