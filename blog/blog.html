	<h1>Understanding Encryption with Ruby!!</h1>
	<h3>Or as we know it: twda (2-shift)</h3>

	<p>In this blog post I'm going to write a bit about encryption. Encryption is a topic I've invested significant time researching outside of my DBC coursework, and I think anyone who wants to keep their information safe could benefit from knowing a little more about how data encryption works.</p>

	<p>To borrow a definition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">Wikipedia(Encryption)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. In an encryption scheme, the intended communication information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, generating ciphertext that can only be read if decrypted.</blockquote>
	
	<p>For example, in the title of this article I put "twda", which would be an example of "cyphertext" or an encrypted message. In this case, the "plaintext" or original message is the word "ruby". </p>

	<p>How do we get "twda" from "ruby"? We used one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption called a <a href="http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/">"caesar cypher"</a>(It was a favorite of the roman emperor Caesar). It involves taking each individual character in a string and shifting it down in the alphabet a certain number of times. So in a shift 2: </p>

	<blockquote>"a" -> "c"</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"b" -> "d"</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"c" -> "e"</blockquote>
	<blockquote>ect...</blockquote>

	<p>For "twda"->"ruby", the encryption process would look like this:</p>

	<blockquote>"r" -> "s" -> "t"</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"u" -> "v" -> "w"</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"b" -> "c" -> "d"</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"y" -> "z" -> "a"</blockquote>

	<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/gaw1990/gaw1990.github.io/blob/master/blog/t8/caesar-cypher-ruby.rb">little Ruby snippet</a> for caesar cyphers that lets you encrypt and descrypt messages for those interested. </p>

	<p>While a caesar cypher might be effective for one word, or passing notes in class, but it's no where near secure. If you had the time (or the code) you could print out each of the 25 shift possiblities and see which one is plain english.</p>

	<p>There are also other methods to decrypt substitution codes (codes in which every letter "y" is subtituted with letter or number "x"). One interesting method uses the frequencies of letter occurance in the english language("e" represents on average 13% of characters, where "z" represents less than 1%) to figure out which characters represent which. <a href= "http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/stochastic-searching/cryptanalysis-caesar-cipher/">(more info on substitution cryptanalysis)</a></p>

	<p>Also consider the modern security climate:</p>
	<p>If I were an american spy in Great Britain who wanted to send a message back to Barak Obama, I would have to send the ecrypted message "twda" and the shift "shift-2" so that he would know how to decode the message when he got it.</p>

	<blockquote>Ideally:</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Secret message + key--->-------The internet--->-------->Barak Obama</blockquote>

	<blockquote>More likely:</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Secret message + key--->-----(local eavsdropper)--->----(isp collection)------> Barak Obama</blockquote>

	<p>The local eavsdropper could be a neighbor who figured out my wifi password, or someone who tampered with public wifi. As we found out from various government leaks, most major governments have the ability to access all out-of-country internet traffic and even citizen-to-citizen traffic if there's suspicion. (In Great Britain it's even stricter, the government has full access to all internet traffic)</p>

	<p>No matter how good your spy encryption is, you have to tell Obama which code you're using so he can decrypt the code himself. The problem: Whatever code + key you send to obama, the eavsdropper will have as well.</p>
	

	<p>There are ways around this problem, like distributing keys in advance then changing them daily. This eliminates the need to transmit a key with a message and improves security.</p>

	<p>But what if you just decided to buy a new jacket online and you didn't set up a key schedule with GAP? That's where something called "Strong Public Key Encryption" comes in.</p>

	<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>

	<p>If you were to open up your "Keychain Access" app in OS X and look through your certificates, you'd see lots of RSA-1024s or RSA-2048s. These are RSA encryption methods, which are the modern standard of encryption. </p>

	<p>The public key(which anyone can see) is based on a private key(which only the person who initiated the communication knows). This allows for an individual with a private key and the encrypted message to quickly decrypt a message, but for an individual with only the public key and encrypted message, decryption with even with the most powerful computers on earth would take an incredibly long time. </p>

	<p>RSA achieves security by relying on the difficulty of factoring extremely large prime numbers and allows for private communication with a minimum of prearrangement. RSA also allows for the interception of both the public key and the encrypted message without reasonable possiblity of decryption. </p>

	<blockquote>Here's an example of a RSA-2048 Number:</blockquote>

    <p>In order to break an encryption made with this number, you'd have to factor it. (There's currently a 200k prize for the first person to decrypt an RSA-2048 number and many beleive it wont happen for years). So you can rest assured (discounting consipracy theories that the NSA can crack RSA-2048 or that there's a built in backdoor) that your data is safe. </p>

	<h1>For loops in JavaScript and Ruby</h1>
	<h3>They're fun!</h3>

	<p>In this blog post I'm going to discuss the differences and similarities between for loops in JavaScript and Ruby. I'm going to explain how they work, their syntaxes and finally how I feel about them.<p>

	<p>So since we've been working on Ruby for 7 weeks, let's start with for loops in Ruby. Their syntax looks like this:</p>

	<blockquote>for some_var in some_range do</blockquote>
	<blockquote>[block of code] </blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>

	<p>Ruby for loops allow us to give a variable,  a range in the form of a boolean expression and then pass the variable a block of code for that range and return the result. </p>

	<p>Lets give a quick, simple Ruby for loop example:</p>

	<blockquote>for i in 0..10 do</blockquote>
	<blockquote>puts i </blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>
	<blockquote>#=></blockquote>
	<blockquote>0</blockquote>
	<blockquote>1</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2</blockquote>
	<blockquote>3</blockquote>
	<blockquote>4</blockquote>
	<blockquote>5</blockquote>
	<blockquote>ect..</blockquote>
	
	<p>We're telling Ruby to, for i in 0 to 10, puts i. So for every number between and including 0 and 10, we're excecuting a puts on the number.</p>
	
	<p>Ruby loops are great because their syntax spells out exactly what's going to happen and they handle discreet number ranges well. Though they do require extra code outside of the loop for counter functions where JavaScript for loops don't.</p>

	<p>Let's look at some example syntax for JavaScript for loops:</p>

	<blockquote>for (first_step; some_range; last_step;){</blockquote>
	<blockquote>[block of code] </blockquote>
	<blockquote>}</blockquote>

	<p>So we give our loop a variable, a range for that variable and a block of code that will be excecuted at the end of every loop. Just FYI, all of the arguements at the top of JavaScript loops are optional. This makes it easy to do something like this in JavaScript:</p>

	<blockquote>for (i=0; i <= 10; i++){</blockquote>
	<blockquote>console.log(i)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>}</blockquote>
	<blockquote>#=></blockquote>
	<blockquote>0</blockquote>
	<blockquote>1</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2</blockquote>
	<blockquote>3</blockquote>
	<blockquote>4</blockquote>
	<blockquote>5</blockquote>
	<blockquote>ect..</blockquote>

	<p>Here we're telling JavaScript to start with i=0, and until i <= 10 returns false, run the code block then 'i++' which increments the value of i up by one.</p>
	<p>JavaScript loops are great because we have variable definition and last step built into the syntax. If we wanted to do that same thing in Ruby, it would look like this:</p>

	<blockquote>counter = 0</blockquote>
	<blockquote>for i in i <=10 do</blockquote>
	<blockquote>puts i</blockquote>
	<blockquote>counter += 1</blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>

	<p>See we had to define a counter variable above the code, and increment it with a line in our code block.</p>

	<p>While Ruby for loops may be easier to pick up and seem simpler, I think that ultimately JavaScript for loops are more effective and intuitive. </p>

	<h1>if require_brain_fuel? == true</h1>
	<h3>ruby coffee.rb</h3>

	<p>Relating objects and processes in programming to examples from everyday life can be an excellent teaching tool. In this blog post I'm going to use a Ruby class to model a coffee machine. I think it's a good object to model because it has a couple simple variables and methods. Plus everyone's familiar with coffee machines, chances are you have a cup of coffee infront of you right now!<p>

	<p>The first thing in our CoffeeMachine class would be an initialize method with instance variables for the water level, coffee level and one boolean variable for whether the machine is warmed up. </p>

	<blockquote>class CoffeeMachine</blockquote>
	<blockquote>def initialize(coffee_beans)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@water_level = 0(0-100)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@bean_level = coffee_beans_grams)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@warmed_up = false</blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>

	<p>We have our @water_level variable to show us how much water is in the machine, our @bean_level gets it's value from the coffee_beans argument because I imagine we'll want to use the different kinds of coffee on our shelf (we're connoisseurs, after all) and finally our warmed_up variable is a boolean that lets us know if the coffee machine is ready to brew.</p>

	<p>Now we have our water, beans and heat variables we need some methods to actually make the coffee. The first method will check if we have enough water and beans for the amount of cups (the argument cups) we want and if the machine is warmed up. Something like this:</p>


	<blockquote>def ready_to_brew?(cups)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>if @water_level > (10 * cups) && @bean_level > (10 * cups) && @warmed_up == true</blockquote>
	<blockquote># if the water level at least 10% per cup wanted, bean level at least 10 grams per cup needed and machine warmed up</blockquote>
	<blockquote>return true</blockquote>
	<blockquote>else</blockquote>
	<blockquote>return false</blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>

	<p>So now we have a method to check if the machine is ready to brew, but what if it returns false because there's not enough water?</p>

	<blockquote>def fill</blockquote>
	<blockquote>#add water</blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>

	<p>A little fill method should take care of our water (if you have to buy beans that's your responsiblity, not this program's). Now we have all of our ingredients and ready_to_brew? returned true, let's brew up a brew method.</p>

	<blockquote>def brew(cups)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>#coffee + heat + water</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@water_level = @water_level - (10 * cups)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@bean_level = @bean_level - (10 * cups)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>return #cup_of_cofee</blockquote>
	<blockquote>end</blockquote>

	<p>Awesome! There you go. The beans and water used have been subtracted from their respective variables and the brew method returned us a cup of coffee. Now you can go write some classes of your own with all your new found energy!</p>

		<h3>Fun with mixins modules and ".map"</h3>

		
		<p>There are a series of methods (like .sort and .group_by) that iterate over arrays using the enumerable mixin module. A module is a block of code that can be called from any class regardless of that class&#8217;s inheritance.</p>

		<p>In Ruby, classes have what&#8217;s called &quot;single inheritance&quot; meaning that they can only inherit behavior from one other class. Modules let us bring reusable blocks of code into a class from outside the direct inheritance structure. Another name for a module we bring into a class or method is a &quot;mix-in&quot; named because we&#8217;re mixing in code from outside of inheritance.</p>

		<p>&quot;.map&quot; is a method that iterates over each item in an array and returns a modified array.  &quot;.map&quot; lives in the &quot;enumerable&quot; module, which is essentially a bunch of methods packaged together into a module that we can mix-in and use without having to define the method every time we want to use it. Enumerable methods include many methods that let us iterate through collections like &quot;.each&quot; and &quot;.select&quot;.</p>

		<p>The method &quot;.map&quot; works like this:</p>

		<blockquote>some_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</blockquote>

		<blockquote>some_array.map { |array_item|
			array_item + 1
			}</blockquote>

		<blockquote>#=> &quot;[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]&quot;</blockquote>

		<p>In this case it took every array item and added one to it. It returns a modified array, but it doesn&#8217;t actually alter the original array. In other words it&#8217;s a non-destructive method, so if we call:</p>

		<blockquote>some_array
		#=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] </blockquote>

		<p>We can see it hasn&#8217;t been permanently changed. </p>

		<p>If we **DO** want to permanently change the array, we can add a &quot;bang&quot; onto the method and we get the method &quot;.map!&quot;.</p>

		<blockquote>some_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</blockquote>

		<blockquote>some_array.map! { |array_item|  # using .map! not .map
			array_item + 1
			}</blockquote>

		<blockquote>#=> &quot;[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]&quot;</blockquote>

		<p>We&#8217;ll get the same return with &quot;.map!&quot; as we did with &quot;.map&quot;, but now if we call some_array again we&#8217;ll get:</p>

		<blockquote>some_array
		#=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</blockquote>

		<p>some_array has been permanently altered.</p>

		<h3>Passwords</h3>

<p>If you're like me and most people in the world, you don't follow best password practices. Consider this:</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://splashdata.com/press/worst-passwords-of-2014.htm">2014 study</a> by an online security company, the top 25 most common passwords represent 2.5% off all passwords. That list includes the greatest hits like "123456" and "iloveyou" as well as "696969" which ranked #22. Classy. Look at the <a href="http://qz.com/501073/the-top-100-passwords-on-ashley-madison/">most common passwords</a> to come out of the recent Ashley Madison hack-- See a pattern?</p>

<p>What about iPhone passwords where a string of 4 numbers could give a stranger access to your email, bank apps and other personal info. According to a <a href="http://danielamitay.com/blog/2011/6/13/most-common-iphone-passcodes">rough study of iPhone passwords</a> by an app developer, the top 10 passwords represent 15% of all passwords. Again, "1234" "1111" and 5683 (the numerical representation of "LOVE") all pop up on the list.</p>

<p>That brings up the question of what makes a good password? From <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2015/soups15-paper-ion.pdf">great google research</a> to some <a href="https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm">provocative password tests</a>, I've picked up a few good practices.</p>

<p>1. Use different passwords for different sites.</p>

<p>This doesn't need much explanation, but consider how more and more sites are using email or facebook as your username. If someone found out one of your passwords on a less secure site, which others could they get into? What about your keychain?</p>

<p>2. Length is more important than complexity.</p>

<p>Which is a more secure password?:</p> 

<p>A. D0g.....................</p> 

<p>B. PrXyc.N(n4k77#L!eVdAfp9</p>

<p>Just by virtue of having more characters, D0g is actually more secure. Those periods after the password are called "padding." It's a good idea to add some kind of padding before or after your password.</p> 

<p>3. Use a password managers</p>

<p>When google researchers asked security experts and non-experts whether or not they use password managers, security experts were 4x more likely to use them.  The biggest reason non-experts avoided password managers was fear of hacking(ie. If the manager was hacked, all their passwords would be leaked). Password managers allow exponentially more password uniqueness and length across all sites and if security experts are that much more likely to use the managers, the benefits must outway the risks.</p>
 
<p>I hope this is helpful and interesting!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

	<h3>Hashes and Arrays</h3>

<p>An Array: A collection of objects indexed as [key] and [value] pairs where the keys are integers starting at [0] and increasing incrementally by 1 and the values are assignable.</p>

<img height="40%" width="40%" src="t3/array-index.png" />

<p>Values can be accessed easily by their keys: (hash1(0) returns "hello", hash1(1) returns "world")</p>

<p>Arrays are the simplest and most efficient data structure in ruby. They can be used to store strings, integers, floats and booleans(all objects!):</p>

<img height="40%" width="40%" src="t3/arrays.png" />

<p>Adding, subtracting or moving data in arrays is fast and efficient becayse the keys in the [key]=[value] pairs are fixed. Having a strict key set allows for easier data manipulation and navigation. Arrays are a popular collection structure in ruby because of this.</p>

<p>Arrays have many benefits, but what if the data is all strings or floats and can't be indexed by a simple number key? That's where hashes come in!</p>

<p>A Hash: A collection of objects indexed as [key] and [value] pairs where the keys and the values are assignable and can be any object type.</p>

<img height="40%" width="40%" src="t3/my_hash.png" />

<p>As you can see, there's an integer, a string and a boolean key-- Hashes give you more freedom than arrays to classify your data, though it can make the data more complicated to access and manipulate.</p>

<p>It's also important to remember that while you can have an unlimited number of similar values, you can only have one of each key.</p>

<img height="40%" width="40%" src="t3/g-b-hash.png" />

<p>"bad_hash" has two identical keys, so if we ask ruby to return bad_hash[favorite_music], ruby will be confused.</p>

<p>"good_hash" has unique keys that will keep ruby happy.</p> 

<p>Depending on what your data looks like and what you're trying to achieve, knowing how to get the most out of Arrays and Hashes in Ruby can make your job much easier!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

		<h1>Margins and Borders and Padding, oh my!</h1>
			<h2>Sept 7, 2015</h2>
		
		<p>Creating space around HTML elements is easy with CSS! Look at this content nested within a box!</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/nested-box.png" alt="nested content" />

		<p>Where is the padding, border and margin you ask? You're looking right at them!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Padding: The white space between the content and the red dotted box</li>
			<li>Border: You guessed it! That red dotted box? That's the border!</li>
			<li>Margin: The white space between the red dotted box and the black box. (it's like padding for the border)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now that we have that down, let's look at how we give elements padding, borders and margins in CSS!</p>
		

		<p>As you can see here, our content is surrounded by a black block element: </p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/content-box.png" alt="content" />

		<p>We don't like the black box being so close to our content, so we're going to add some padding in CSS like this:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/content-padding-css.png" alt="padding in CSS" />

		<p>Awesome! Now look at how much space our content has!</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/content-padding-pic.png" alt="padding" />

		<p>We gave it 100px of padding on every side! That's great, but now let's make it stand out a little more with a bright magenta border!</p>
		<p>We add the border property into our CSS file:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/magenta-border.png" alt="magenta border" />

		<p>Now our content looks like this:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/magenta-ss.png" alt="magenta border" />

		<p>Which is great.. Except for the fact that our border is WAY too close to the black box element. Lucky for us, we can give the border a little room to breathe with a margin!</p>
		<p>In our CSS file we'll add a margin property to our content like this:</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/margin-css.png" alt="magenta border" />

		<p>Now our content is well highlighted and has enough space to breathe!</p>

			<img height="30%" width="30%" src="../imgs/margin-ss.png" alt="magenta border" />


		<p>Now go out and create some space of your own and never fear spacing properties in CSS again!</p>

	<h1>Version Control</h1>

  	<h2>And why you (as a developer) need it!</h2>
  	
  	<h4>July 23, 2015</h4>

	<p>--Version Control--</p>

	<p>When developers work on collaborative projects, it’s a challenge to keep everyone up to date with each other’s edits and saves while maintaining one bug-free and usable version. To manage these issues we use “Version Control” systems.</p>

	<p>Version control could be as simple as a college student classifying an essay as “first draft”, making edits in the margins and revising a “working draft” then polishing it up and submitting a “final draft”. The basic advantages of version control remain:</p>

	<p>1. an accessible history of edits and saves
	</p>    

	<p>2. versions that can be reverted to (if new edits don’t work)</p>

	<p>Let’s say now the next assignment is one essay to be worked on by the entire class, with separate groups working on grammar, vocabulary, formatting, and research— That’s sort of like working on  a piece of software and it can get complicated.</p>

	<p>To handle these large collaborative projects, developers use systems like git and GitHub to understand the who, when and why of edits as well as keeping a central, up to date version of the project.</p>

	<p>--Git--</p>

	<p>Git is a program that allows users to work on a project through evolving iterations, while always keeping a history of changes that can be reverted to. Git lives on your local computer and keeps track of changes through commits (like checkpoints or save points) and versions.</p>

	<p>To borrow an often used analogy, git’s version control system can be compared to a tree. The trunk of the tree being the master (a functional version that can be reverted back to) and the branches being working versions (new changes that are in progress or haven’t been completely tested).</p>

	<p>The implementation of a change might look like this:</p>
	
	<p>1. a copy of the master branch is created</p> 

	<p>2. an edit is made to our copy</p>

	<p>3. the edit is tested until we’re confident it doesn’t interfere with the rest of the program</p>

	<p>4. the edit is “committed” along with a “commit message” letting us know where and why we made an edit</p>

	<p>5. when we’re confident in the changes we merge the branch back into the trunk, creating an updated master branch that we can now make more branches from.</p>

	<p>The biggest benefit of this system is being able to experiment and play with our project without having to compromise it’s integrity.</p>

	<p>--GitHub--</p>
	
	<p>If it’s our project is collaborative, there will be multiple people making and approving changes. That’s where GitHub comes in. GitHub allows teams to have a master version that’s available to all members, and a central place to implement their edits.</p>

	<p>GitHub can be thought of as a bigger tree available to all collaborators where you can push changes up and pull the most current version down. The biggest advantage of GitHub is it allows teams working remotely to avoid stepping on each others toes while building projects.</p>

	<p>GitHub is simple and extremely user friendly. It also has a huge social aspect in which you can make your projects public and anyone can come in and contribute changes. Do yourself a favor and check it out!</p>

	<h1>DBC Culture</h1>

  	<h2>Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the code</h2>

	<p>To put it frankly, I’m super excited for this journey ;)</p>

    <p>I love that Dev Bootcamp addresses fears and doubts head on. Something I’ve been working on in my everyday life is working through anger, fear and other intense/distracting emotions. It’s so easy to get swept up in these emotions and for a long time I didn’t realize there is another choice.</p>

    <p>Staying in the anxiety, the stress. Experiencing it, not judging yourself for feeling it, then acting from within the storm. This is not easy to do and I’m still learning, but that DBC incorporates this kind of mindset as a part of it’s curriculum get’s me excited for what’s to come.</p>

    <p>My expectations of DBC have changed greatly. I definitely find myself sometimes coming from a consumer or restaurant mindset. I think a lot of that has to do with justifying my actions to other people. Saying “yeah it’s 20 weeks and most people land 65k+/yr jobs off the bat” is easy. Much easier than saying “No, I’m not 100% sure coding is for me. I worry that the program is too emotionally centered. But I think working with code is awesome and it makes me feel like I’m behind the curtain and I can’t remember being this excited to learn something and test my limits since I can remember”.</p>

    <p>One is going to sound much better to my family members.</p>

    <p>So yes, I’m having doubts for sure— I’m nervous I’ll be too quick a learner for some people, I’m nervous I’ll look like an idiot compared to others. When I’m sucked up in those thoughts, they feel real— But right now I can tell you (and myself) that these thoughts come from a place of irrational insecurity.</p>

    <p>It’s natural to feel like helping someone else is putting yourself behind, or that exposing vulnerability and asking for help means your weak or lesser. Like that there are only 10 jobs for the 17 people in the Chicago cohort and it’s dog eat dog. Is that true? Of course not, that’s ridiculous. We’re all on the path and if you want to find out what you’re capable of you have to become vulnerable and risk failure.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, enough rambling— It’s Sunday night and I still have to do the week 1 quiz.</p>

    <p>Cheers guys,</p>
