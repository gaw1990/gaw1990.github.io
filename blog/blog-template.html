	   ==2.7 Reflection Prompt==
-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Thanks to an awesome partner, it was pretty easy and fun. They were very knoledgable about HTML especially semantic elements (which I did not get at first) which made things easy. We partially worked together and partly as driver/navigator and rocked.

-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yeah, it was nice to have an idea to aim for when listing out elements. That being said, I think a wireframe might come in more handy in a larger project with more scope.

-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We didn't talk a lot about what makes a good wireframe and what doesn't,
but we did work on making them as simple as possible. 

-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
<Nav> was one. We spent half an hour trying to figure out how to line up
elements horizontally. We weren't sure if that was an HTML or CSS duty.
Ultimately it lead us to do a lot of research on semantic elements. I'm still not completely sure of what their role is, but hopefully that's
clarified during the CSS portion of this course.
