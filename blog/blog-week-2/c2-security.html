<h1>Passwords</h1>
<h4>September 14, 2015</h4>

<p>If you're like me and most people in the world, you don't follow best password practices. Consider this:</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://splashdata.com/press/worst-passwords-of-2014.htm">2014 study</a> by an online security company, the top 25 most common passwords represent 2.5% off all passwords. That list includes the greatest hits like "123456" and "iloveyou" as well as "696969" which ranked #22. Classy. Look at the <a href="http://qz.com/501073/the-top-100-passwords-on-ashley-madison/">most common passwords</a> to come out of the recent Ashley Madison hack-- See a pattern?</p>

<p>What about iPhone passwords where a string of 4 numbers could give a stranger access to your email, bank apps and other personal info. According to a <a href="http://danielamitay.com/blog/2011/6/13/most-common-iphone-passcodes">rough study of iPhone passwords</a> by an app developer, the top 10 passwords represent 15% of all passwords. Again, "1234" "1111" and 5683 (the numerical representation of "LOVE") all pop up on the list.</p>

<p>That brings up the question of what makes a good password? From <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2015/soups15-paper-ion.pdf">great google research</a> to some <a href="https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm">provocative password tests</a>, I've picked up a few good practices.</p>

<p>1. Use different passwords for different sites.</p>

<p>This doesn't need much explanation, but consider how more and more sites are using email or facebook as your username. If someone found out one of your passwords on a less secure site, which others could they get into? What about your keychain?</p>

<p>2. Length is more important than complexity.</p>

<p>Which is a more secure password?:</p> 

<p>A. D0g.....................</p> 

<p>B. PrXyc.N(n4k77#L!eVdAfp9</p>

<p>Just by virtue of having more characters, D0g is actually more secure. Those periods after the password are called "padding." It's a good idea to add some kind of padding before or after your password.</p> 

<p>3. Use a password managers</p>

<p>When google researchers asked security experts and non-experts whether or not they use password managers, security experts were 4x more likely to use them.  The biggest reason non-experts avoided password managers was fear of hacking(ie. If the manager was hacked, all their passwords would be leaked). Password managers allow exponentially more password uniqueness and length across all sites and if security experts are that much more likely to use the managers, the benefits must outway the risks.</p>
 
<p>I hope this is helpful and interesting!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
