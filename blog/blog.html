	<h1>Version Control</h1>

  	<h2>And why you (as a developer) need it!</h2>
  	
  	<h4>July 23, 2015</h4>

	<p>--Version Control--</p>

	<p>When developers work on collaborative projects, it’s a challenge to keep everyone up to date with each other’s edits and saves while maintaining one bug-free and usable version. To manage these issues we use “Version Control” systems.</p>

	<p>Version control could be as simple as a college student classifying an essay as “first draft”, making edits in the margins and revising a “working draft” then polishing it up and submitting a “final draft”. The basic advantages of version control remain:</p>

	<p>1. an accessible history of edits and saves
	</p>    

	<p>2. versions that can be reverted to (if new edits don’t work)</p>

	<p>Let’s say now the next assignment is one essay to be worked on by the entire class, with separate groups working on grammar, vocabulary, formatting, and research— That’s sort of like working on  a piece of software and it can get complicated.</p>

	<p>To handle these large collaborative projects, developers use systems like git and GitHub to understand the who, when and why of edits as well as keeping a central, up to date version of the project.</p>

	<p>--Git--</p>

	<p>Git is a program that allows users to work on a project through evolving iterations, while always keeping a history of changes that can be reverted to. Git lives on your local computer and keeps track of changes through commits (like checkpoints or save points) and versions.</p>

	<p>To borrow an often used analogy, git’s version control system can be compared to a tree. The trunk of the tree being the master (a functional version that can be reverted back to) and the branches being working versions (new changes that are in progress or haven’t been completely tested).</p>

	<p>The implementation of a change might look like this:</p>
	
	<p>1. a copy of the master branch is created</p> 

	<p>2. an edit is made to our copy</p>

	<p>3. the edit is tested until we’re confident it doesn’t interfere with the rest of the program</p>

	<p>4. the edit is “committed” along with a “commit message” letting us know where and why we made an edit</p>

	<p>5. when we’re confident in the changes we merge the branch back into the trunk, creating an updated master branch that we can now make more branches from.</p>

	<p>The biggest benefit of this system is being able to experiment and play with our project without having to compromise it’s integrity.</p>

	<p>--GitHub--</p>
	
	<p>If it’s our project is collaborative, there will be multiple people making and approving changes. That’s where GitHub comes in. GitHub allows teams to have a master version that’s available to all members, and a central place to implement their edits.</p>

	<p>GitHub can be thought of as a bigger tree available to all collaborators where you can push changes up and pull the most current version down. The biggest advantage of GitHub is it allows teams working remotely to avoid stepping on each others toes while building projects.</p>

	<p>GitHub is simple and extremely user friendly. It also has a huge social aspect in which you can make your projects public and anyone can come in and contribute changes. Do yourself a favor and check it out!</p>

	<h1>DBC Culture</h1>

  	<h2>Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the code</h2>

  	<h4>August 23, 2015</h4>

	<p>To put it frankly, I’m super excited for this journey ;)</p>

    <p>I love that Dev Bootcamp addresses fears and doubts head on. Something I’ve been working on in my everyday life is working through anger, fear and other intense/distracting emotions. It’s so easy to get swept up in these emotions and for a long time I didn’t realize there is another choice.</p>

    <p>Staying in the anxiety, the stress. Experiencing it, not judging yourself for feeling it, then acting from within the storm. This is not easy to do and I’m still learning, but that DBC incorporates this kind of mindset as a part of it’s curriculum get’s me excited for what’s to come.</p>

    <p>My expectations of DBC have changed greatly. I definitely find myself sometimes coming from a consumer or restaurant mindset. I think a lot of that has to do with justifying my actions to other people. Saying “yeah it’s 20 weeks and most people land 65k+/yr jobs off the bat” is easy. Much easier than saying “No, I’m not 100% sure coding is for me. I worry that the program is too emotionally centered. But I think working with code is awesome and it makes me feel like I’m behind the curtain and I can’t remember being this excited to learn something and test my limits since I can remember”.</p>

    <p>One is going to sound much better to my family members.</p>

    <p>So yes, I’m having doubts for sure— I’m nervous I’ll be too quick a learner for some people, I’m nervous I’ll look like an idiot compared to others. When I’m sucked up in those thoughts, they feel real— But right now I can tell you (and myself) that these thoughts come from a place of irrational insecurity.</p>

    <p>It’s natural to feel like helping someone else is putting yourself behind, or that exposing vulnerability and asking for help means your weak or lesser. Like that there are only 10 jobs for the 17 people in the Chicago cohort and it’s dog eat dog. Is that true? Of course not, that’s ridiculous. We’re all on the path and if you want to find out what you’re capable of you have to become vulnerable and risk failure.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, enough rambling— It’s Sunday night and I still have to do the week 1 quiz.</p>

    <p>Cheers guys,</p>

    <p>George</p>
